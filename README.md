PLANET CONQUEST (PlanetCon)
===========================

<img src="https://github.com/dftec-es/planetcon/blob/master/Screenshot.png"></a>

PlanetCon is a simple turn based strategy game, of galactic conquest, similar to 
Konquest for Linux. It can be played by 1 to 9 players, against AI adversaries 
controlled by the computer, or against other people in the same device.

Players start with a planet that produces a number of ships each turn, and they 
can send fleets of ships in order to conquer other planets, with the final 
objective of conquering the whole galaxy, or to produce more ships than the 
opponents at the end of the last turn.

Most of the development was focused on getting an AI that can beat a human, 
enjoyable to play, no easily predictable, and able to run on low spec mobiles.
